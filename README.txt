Hi. I am going for "Exceeds Expectations" grade, but if it doesn't exceed I will be okay with "Meets Expectations" grade. Thank you.

Here are some changes I've made:

1. Changed the color of 'prev' and 'next' buttons to green, when the user reaches the end or beginning of the list, the color of a corresponding button changes to blue.
2. Added fadeIn and fadeOut effects to the modal window using jQuery.
3. Changed background image.
4. Changed a color of a card being hovered by the user.
5. Added zooming effect of a card being hovered.
6. Added zooming effect on an image in a modal window.
